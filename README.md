### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kellen, a DevOps Engineer based in London.

I'm currently working on tons of cloud stuff, and I love dabbling in a variety of weird stuff like:

- Reverse engineering
- ASM programming on old 8-bit and 16-bit computers
- Making programming languages/VMs

I also have a weird fascination with all kinds of networking protocols and run [Geoff Network](https://geoff.network) as an educational project for myself. You can read some stuff I've written about all of the above on [my blog](https://kscarlett.com). If you also love this stuff and you want to get in touch, feel free to reach out to me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/_kscarlett_).
